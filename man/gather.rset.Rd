\title{Gather an `rset` Object}
\usage{
\method{gather}{rset}(data, key = NULL, value = NULL, ...,
  na.rm = TRUE, convert = FALSE, factor_key = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An `rset` object.}

\item{key, value, ...}{Not specified in this method and will be
ignored. Note that this means that selectors are ignored if
they are passed to the function.}

\item{na.rm}{If `TRUE`, will remove rows from output where the
value column in `NA`.}

\item{convert}{If `TRUE` will automatically run
`type.convert()` on the key column. This is useful if the column
names are actually numeric, integer, or logical.}

\item{factor_key}{If FALSE, the default, the key values will be
stored as a character vector. If `TRUE`, will be stored as a
factor, which preserves the original ordering of the columns.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the ID columns, a column called
 `model` (with the previous column names), and a column called
 `statistic` (with the values).
}
\description{
This method uses `gather` on an `rset` object to stack all of
 the non-ID or split columns in the data and is useful for
 stacking model evaluation statistics. The resulting data frame
 has a column based on the column names of `data` and another for
 the values.
